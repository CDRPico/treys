TODO 1:

TODO:
Evaluate hands and combos
By constructing the evaluation of draws at every street I can proceed to generate the algorithms which
will the generate profitable strategies to play different hands, specially those common situations headed by
many draws against hands done such as trips or straights

evaluate hands preflop by running simulations to create ranges

compare potential of hands after flop
--- How to compare when cards of the draw come down
